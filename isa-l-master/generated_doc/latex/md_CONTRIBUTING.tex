Everyone is welcome to contribute. Patches may be submitted using Git\-Hub pull requests (P\-Rs). All commits must be signed off by the developer (--signoff) which indicates that you agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin. Patch discussion will happen directly on the Git\-Hub P\-R. Design pre-\/work and general discussion occurs on the \href{https://lists.01.org/hyperkitty/list/isal@lists.01.org/}{\tt mailing list}. Anyone can provide feedback in either location and all discussion is welcome. Decisions on whether to merge patches will be handled by the maintainer.
